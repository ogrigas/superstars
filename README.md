# Java Superstars

A JSON-over-HTTP API that retrieves 10 most active GitHub Java frameworks, in terms of the number of stargazers.
Stats include star count and total number of contributors.

Clients may optionally provide their GitHub credentials, which unlocks additional features:
- star a repo
- unstar a repo
- see whether they have starred a repo

## Developer guidelines
